The `component` module exports a factory method, providing a declarative way of generating `Kefir.Observable`s to manage the application UI lifecycle. They are designed to mount an already rendered DOM, with the server providing the DOM and a `Kefir.Observable` of component props.

`component` factories can be composed of several `Kefir.Observable`-returning functions, described below, which form a `Kefir.Observable`-returning function of its own. All of the  configuration is optional; a `component` that doesn't do anything may not be particularly useful, but it is valid.

# How to Use

A `component` factory function is generated by passing an configuration object into the factory method.

```js
// dummy.js
import { Kefir, component, events, render } from 'brookjs';
import template from './index.hbs';

export default component({
  events: events({
    onClick: evt$ => evt$.map(() => ({ type: 'DUMMY_CLICK' }))
  }),
  render: render(template)
});
```

Somewhere else, mount the component to its element and subscribe to its actions:

```js
// app.js
import DummyComponent from './dummy';

const { __INITIAL_STATE__ } = global;

const app = DummyComponent(el.getElementById('app'), __INITIAL_STATE__);

let sub = app.observe({ value: action => console.log(action)});
```

Each of these configuration options have an associated `brookjs` module, which exports a factory method for generating these functions from a configuration.

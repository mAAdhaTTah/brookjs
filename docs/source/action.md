The `action` module provides the action constants and creators that `brookjs` uses internally. These can be used to interact with any of the streams exported by the framework. The `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` strings are the action type, while the `camelCaseAction` functions are the action creators. All actions generated by the framework comply with the [Flux Standard Action][fsa].

# Api

## `RAF` & `rafAction`

Emitted by the `raf$` stream on a `requestAnimationFrame` tick.

```flow
type RafAction = {
    type : RAF;
    payload : {
        time : DOMHighResTimeStamp;
    };
}
```

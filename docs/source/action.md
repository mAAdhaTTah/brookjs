The `action` module provides the action constants and creators that `brookjs` uses internally. These can be used to interact with any of the streams exported by the framework. The `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` strings are the action type, while the `camelCaseAction` functions are the action creators. All actions generated by the framework comply with the [Flux Standard Action][fsa].

# Api

## `RAF` & `raf$`

The `raf$` stream emits a `RafAction` on a `requestAnimationFrame` tick. This will schedule renders in sync with the framework rendering flow.

```flow
type RafAction = {
    type: typeof RAF;
    payload: {
        time: DOMHighResTimeStamp;
    };
}
```

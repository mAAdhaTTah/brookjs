# Meet brookjs

- This should be more of a "sales pitch" than description
    - The opening blurb has Big Word Syndrome

`brookjs` is a framework for building functional, reactive JavaScript applications. The core of the library is built on [`kefir`][kefir] (Observables) and [`ramda`][ramda] (functional utilities). No other dependencies are required, and the framework is designed to be as flexible as possible, allowing you to pick and choose which modules to use while designing them to work together seamlessly in common patterns. While not required, [`redux`][redux] is recommended for state management, with its `Symbol.observable` interop, solid developer tooling, and supportive community. A number of `brookjs` modules are designed to integrate with `redux`.

`brookjs` modules handle various aspects of an application, with the core of the library being the `component` module, handling the DOM lifecycle, and the `observeDelta` middleware, which provides an Observable-based `redux` middleware for managing side effects. Additional modules provide support for other application functionality.

## Why brookjs?

- Automatically performant
    - Using `view` at the edges makes sure minimal number of changes required
- Components become solely I/O
    - Props stream in, events stream out
    - Public interface is clear & consistent
    - No internal state by default
- We model the entire application this way
    - One true way to solve problems
    - Each area of the application functions in isolation
        - Listen to commands (state in view), emit events
        - No side effect handling logic leaks
- Observables are great for handling async in JavaScript
    - Easier to handle complex dependencies between async sources
- Application logic lives in store
    - Easy to test, statically typeable
- Develop robust, bug-free programs with quality tooling
    - Easiest path is the happy path
    - Discourage shortcuts

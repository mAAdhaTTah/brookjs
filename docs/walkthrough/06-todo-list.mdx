# Todo List

Split into multiple pages?

- Expand components for everything we need for a basic todo app
    - Reuse the button component for edit & remove click!
    - Show how to map actions based on context using `mapActionsTo` and `preplug`
    - Use `loop` for reactive children.
- Replace log & `fromPoll` with Redux store
    - Gloss over the details here, will link out to CodeSandbox
    - Use `fromReduxStore` to convert store -> observable
    - Plug emitted actions into store
    - Go through bootstrapping logic (generated by CLI)
- CodeSandbox example
    - Link files as we explain concepts, but keep code off the page

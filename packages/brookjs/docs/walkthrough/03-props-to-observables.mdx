# Props to Observables

- Build a basic React component (button w/ text & onClick)
- Convert text to observable with `view` helper
- Highlight ease with which React makes fewest # of changes required
- Note that we call `render` once in application code
  - `brookjs` handles triggering updates when observable emits a new value

# Quickstart

Bootstrap a new application:

```shell
npx brookjs-cli new myapp
```

You'll see a new folder structured like this:

```tree
myapp
|____.babelrc
|____.beaverrc.js
|____.eslintrc.js
|____package-lock.json
|____package.json
|____src
  |____actions
  | |____app.js
  | |____index.js
  |____app.js
  |____components
  | |____index.js
  |____deltas
  | |____index.js
  |____dom.js
  |____reducers
  | |____index.js
  |____selectors
  | |____index.js
  |____services
  | |____index.js
  |____view.hbs
```

The CLI expects the application to be structured this way, in order for the commands to function as expected. In order to understand what each of the parts do, take a look through the [walkthrough](http://localhost:3000/walkthrough/introduction).

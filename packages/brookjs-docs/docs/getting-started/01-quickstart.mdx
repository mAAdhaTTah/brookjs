# Quickstart

Bootstrap a new application:

```shell
npx brookjs-cli new myapp
```

You'll see a new folder structured like this:

```tree
myapp
|____.storybook
| |____.babelrc
| |____main.js
|____.beaverrc.js
|____public
| |____index.html
| |____manifest.json
|____package.json
|____src
| |____index.js
| |____state
| | |____index.js
| | |______tests__
| | | |____state.spec.js
| |____components
| | |______stories__
| | | |____App.stories.js
| | |____index.js
| | |______tests__
| | | |____App.spec.js
| | |____App.js
| |____deltas
| | |____index.js
| |______tests__
| | |____storyshots.spec.js
| | |______snapshots__
| | | |____storyshots.spec.js.snap
| |____actions
| | |____index.js
| | |____app.js
| |____setupTests.js
```

The CLI is \_very opinionated, but it is not a requirement for working with `brookjs`. You can configure various aspects of the CLI, including which folder your source code is in, through the `.beaverrc.js` file, but this is the default folder your application lives in. By default, the CLI provides:

- Prettier
- ESLint
- Jest
- Storybook
- Storyshots
- Webpack + dev server
- Puppeteer

Alternatively, you could use an tool like [Create React App](cra), which works perfectly well with `brookjs`.

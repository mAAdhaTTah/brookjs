# Actions: Commands vs Events

- Events are "something happened"
  - Context
- Commands are "do this thing"
- Everything is controlled in the Redux store
  - All state + behavior described in pure functions
  - Application logic exists in pure, testable store
- All delta-managed side effects are commands in, events out
  - translate commands -> side effects
  - emit events when things happen
  - Replace deltas or view layer with zero disruption to rest of application
